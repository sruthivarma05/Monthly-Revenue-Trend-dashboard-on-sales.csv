# Monthly-Revenue-Trend-dashboard-on-sales.csv
Cleaned sales data and created a monthly revenue trends dashboard to help stakeholders understand performance.
I used Python and the Pandas library to clean and prepare the sales dataset for analysis. I imported the data from the CSV file and explored it to understand its structure and content. The Sale_Date column was converted to a proper datetime format for time-series analysis. I created calculated columns for Profit, Revenue, and Profit Margin to capture key business metrics, and extracted Year, Month, and Quarter from the sale dates to make trend analysis easier. I checked for duplicates and confirmed the dataset was clean. The prepared data was saved as a new CSV file for use in the dashboard.

Using this cleaned dataset, I built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to help stakeholders understand business performance. I created a monthly revenue trend line chart to show how revenue changed across 2023. KPI cards display total Revenue, Profit, and Quantity Sold, while column charts show Profit by Sales Channel and Customer Type. Geographical maps visualize Profit by Region and by the combined Region and Sales Rep. All visuals are interactive, so selecting a region or category updates the other charts automatically. The dashboard is visually clear, engaging, and provides stakeholders with actionable insights for data-driven decision making.
